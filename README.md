# simple-web-parser
- As of now, this is a very simple iteration of what is supposed to be a practical web scraper.
- Parses webpages as an html using pandas.
- Particularly parses tabular data.
- For example, A table with x,y coordinates and ascii characters is able to be parsed and nicely printed to the screen on a 2D grid.
- Lots of data comes organized in some tabular form, which is why I chose to start here.
- Written in python.
